# Gilded Rose

This is the Gilded Rose kata in JavaScript with Jest

Set for my 10th week at Makers Academy. 

## Getting started

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Running tests

To run all tests

```sh
npm test
```

To run all tests in watch mode

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

To generate test coverage report

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```
## My Approach

- First I familiarised myself with the README which gave some fundamental aspects of how the code works
- THis wasn't completely enlightening so I then set about to loading the 'texttest_ficxture.js' and then called `gildedRose.updateQuality()` and took note of the returns and how the items changed.
- Before considering implementing Conjured items, I knew I would need to buold up an entire test suite of everything I observed of the existing code logic. Then I can begin to refactor and implement.
